Common Commands
PING
Use case: Before embarking on any data operations, an application can send a PING to ensure that the Redis server is alive and responsive—like knocking on a door before entering.

ECHO
Use case: A debugging tool or simple utility to test network connectivity by having the server repeat a message. It can also be used in logging systems to trace commands.

FLUSHALL
Use case: When resetting a cache or starting fresh, FLUSHALL clears all stored keys. This is useful during development or when you need to wipe out stale data completely.

Key/Value Operations
SET
Use case: Caching user session information or configuration settings. For example, store a user token with SET session:123 "user_data".

GET
Use case: Retrieve stored configuration or session data. For instance, fetch the user session with GET session:123.

KEYS
Use case: List all keys or keys matching a pattern (e.g., KEYS session:*) to analyze cache usage or to perform maintenance tasks.

TYPE
Use case: Check what type of value is stored at a key—useful when the data structure can vary, such as determining if a key holds a string, list, or hash.

DEL / UNLINK
Use case: Remove keys that are no longer valid. This might be used to evict a stale cache entry after a user logs out or when cleaning up expired data.

EXPIRE
Use case: Set a timeout on keys for caching. For example, cache product details for 3600 seconds so that the cache automatically evicts old data.

RENAME
Use case: When restructuring keys during a migration or data reorganization, use RENAME to change the key’s name without losing its data.

List Operations
LGET
Use case: Returns all elements of a list at a given key (much like LRANGE key 0 -1 in real Redis).

LLEN
Use case: Check the number of items in a message queue. For instance, determine how many tasks are pending in a job queue.

LPUSH / RPUSH
Use case: Add items to a list. This is common in task queues or message brokers—LPUSH can be used to add a high-priority task at the beginning, while RPUSH appends regular tasks at the end.

LPOP / RPOP
Use case: Remove items from a list. For example, dequeue a task from the beginning with LPOP or remove the last entry with RPOP in a double-ended queue.

LREM
Use case: Remove specific elements from a list. For instance, eliminate duplicate notifications or remove a cancelled task from a list.

LINDEX
Use case: Retrieve an element at a specific index. Useful when you need to inspect a particular item in a task queue without removing it.

LSET
Use case: Update an element at a given position. This might be used in a real-time messaging app where you need to modify a message that is stored in a list.

Hash Operations
HSET
Use case: Store multiple fields for an object. For example, a user profile with HSET user:1000 name "Alice" age "30" email "alice@example.com".

HGET
Use case: Retrieve a specific field from a hash. For instance, fetching the email of a user with HGET user:1000 email.

HEXISTS
Use case: Check if a particular field exists in a hash. For example, verify if a user profile has an "address" field.

HDEL
Use case: Remove a field from a hash. Use it to delete outdated information, like removing a phone number when a user updates their profile.

HGETALL
Use case: Retrieve all fields and values of a hash. This is useful when you need the full data set of an object, such as fetching an entire user profile.

HKEYS / HVALS
Use case: List all fields (HKEYS) or all values (HVALS) in a hash, which is useful for displaying summary information or iterating through all data points in an object.

HLEN
Use case: Determine the number of fields in a hash. For example, quickly checking how many attributes are stored in a user profile.

HMSET Use case: Set multiple fields in a hash at once. This can be useful for batch updates or initializing an object with several properties simultaneously.
